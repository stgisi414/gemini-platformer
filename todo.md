Gameplay Enhancements
Double Jump: Implement a double jump feature to allow the player to jump a second time in mid-air for a total of 150% of the normal jump height. This will require modifications to the useKeyboardInput.ts hook and the game logic in App.tsx to track an additional jump state.

Special Attack: Add a special attack that allows the player to shoot a projectile to defeat enemies. This will involve adding a new key listener for the attack button, creating a projectile management system, and updating the collision detection logic to handle projectile-enemy interactions.

World and Enemy Polish
Expanded Tile Assets: Integrate a wider variety of tile assets to create a more visually diverse and engaging game world. This will involve updating the ASSET_URLS in constants.ts and modifying the levelGenerator.ts to incorporate the new tiles into the level generation logic.

Subtle Enemy Animations: Add subtle animations to the enemies, such as particle effects or shaders, to make them more dynamic and visually appealing.

Slime Movement Bug: Fix the bug where the slime enemy hovers over the edge of a ledge by one tile when moving left. This will require adjusting the enemy's collision detection and movement logic to ensure it respects platform boundaries.
